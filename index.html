  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I am a senior graphic designer, owner of a small design studio back to my hometown, Taiwan.  Iâ€™m passionate about design as a means to solve business problems by bringing meaningful visual solutions among clients. 

My primary design experience has been in VI design for exhibition, packaging , illustrations, collaterals and partial web design.  I find challenges to define problems and seek the best design solutions by direct interaction with clients.  The business practice has taught me realistic aspects of design world.

Beyond my design career, I have nourished my life by traveling among different countries, indulging in photography, drawing and painting. I learn the beauty of different cultures by traveling.  Photo shooting is a good way to keep me visually aware of my surroundings, while drawing and painting helps link fine art with design.
